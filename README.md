# Open-university-java-homework5
in this assignment we were asked to implement linked list of Rectangleas that we receive from the user, the rest of the insturctions of this assignment will be in the readme file.

first we where asked to implement The class RectNode that will represent a node in a linked list that has a rectangle in it.

secondly we where asked to implement the class RectList that will represent a linked list of rectangles.
We have different functions in this class, we have builders that start the list only to be null, we have a function for adding rectangles, we have a function that checks the number of rectangles we have in the linked list, we also have fucntion that checks if we dont have exactly the same rectangles in our linked list.
as well we have a function that checks the points of each rectangle(In the Cartesian system of axes),
and finally after receiving the list of the rectangles from the user we print the list with its amount of rectangles and with the height and the width and the southwest points of each of the rectangles in the list, if there are no rectangles in the list then we print the proper message for this as well.

And we were also asked to analyze in all the functions in the above class and their running time complexity of the program. and also to analyze the space complexity of the program. of course we was asked to do so in the minimum as possible in terms of space and time complexity.

The analysis of the running time and place complexity are written in the comments above the code.
